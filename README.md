Here's the README


You are tasked with creating an administrator portal for an e-commerce website which will include.

Welcome to the GamesMart Admin Portal!

On our "Game Stores" tab, you can find a list of all GamesMart stores
-clicking a specific Store will give a description of the store, contact information, and a list of the current inventory
-clicking on a specific game in a store's inventory will take to the page for that game, where you will find all info about said game.
    -You will also be able to increase the price for that game but only increase, because lets face it, games are only getting more expensive!
On our Admin page, you will find the forms for Admins to 1) add a new store location, and 2) add a new game to an existing store location.

Enjoy!
